Instead of relying on humans to perform tasks such as deployment, scaling, and backup, an Operator encodes operational knowledge directly into Kubernetes.\nThis guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for building a simple MySQL Operator with Kubebuilder. It is written for beginners and includes full code samples and explanations.\nWhy Operators? Automation: Routine tasks (create, scale, backup) are automated. Consistency: Applications always converge to the desired state. Declarative management: Users describe intent in a Custom Resource (CR), and the Operator ensures the system matches.

This article provides a clear explanation of what closures are, how they work in Go, and some common pitfalls developers should be aware of.\nWhat Is a Closure? A closure is a function bundled together with its surrounding environment. It consists of two elements:\nFunction – the inner function returned by an outer function. This can be a named function, an anonymous function, or a lambda expression. Environment – the variables captured from the outer scope that remain accessible even after the outer function has returned. In practice, closures allow functions to retain access to variables that were in scope when the function was defined—even if those variables are no longer available in the current call stack.\n","date":"26 Aug 2025","image":"https://zhangsiming-bailiyingqi.github.io/images/go-closures.jpg","permalink":"https://zhangsiming-bailiyingqi.github.io/posts/go/go-closures/","title":"Understanding Closures in Go"},{"content":"","date":"25 Aug 2025","image":"https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800","permalink":"https://zhangsiming-bailiyingqi.github.io/posts/tags/tags-example3/","title":"tag algorithm"},{"content":"","date":"25 Aug 2025","image":"https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800","permalink":"https://zhangsiming-bailiyingqi.github.io/posts/tags/tags-example4/","title":"tag English"},{"content":"","date":"25 Aug 2025","image":"https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800","permalink":"https://zhangsiming-bailiyingqi.github.io/posts/tags/tags-example/","title":"tag golang"},{"content":"","date":"25 Aug 2025","image":"https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800","permalink":"https://zhangsiming-bailiyingqi.github.io/posts/tags/tags-example5/","title":"tag interview"},{"content":"","date":"25 Aug 2025","image":"https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800","permalink":"https://zhangsiming-bailiyingqi.github.io/posts/tags/tags-example2/","title":"tag kubernetes"},{"content":"","date":"25 Aug 2025","image":"https://via.placeholder.com/1200x800","permalink":"https://zhangsiming-bailiyingqi.github.io/posts/tags/tags-example1/","title":"tag vue"}]
